# pandas-challenge

This repository follows a pandas-centric python code that allow for the breakdown and analysis of a region level achievement of school students in literacy and numeracy.

The repository has 3 primary components

1) Resources folder: contains the base material of the code, being split into student achievement and school data
2) PyCitySchools_starter is the code created to breakdown the files in the Resources folder
3) Analysis folder: Contains a word document that breaks down the sorted and filtered data from the viewpoint of a regional Minister of Education. It annotates steps taken within the methodology, analyses the data, then formulates possible next steps from this data
